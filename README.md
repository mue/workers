Mue Cloudflare Workers scripts

Currently the only script is a proxy to APIs such as OpenWeatherMap and Unsplash to prevent leakage of API tokens.

## Notice
This was made specifically for Mue, if you wish to use the routes please host your own copy, all of the APIs and services used in the workers have free tiers that will work for most projects.

## Installation
See the [documentation](https://docs.muetab.com/development/#proxy).
